---The Ball Game---
The only to make to sure that computer wins everytime is to make the net ball picked up in a turn comprising men and
computer results in 5, in that manner only, we'll be left with 1 single ball at the 21st turn, which will be of human,
and at that moment he'll be left with 1 ball only, resulting in computer's win in the game.
